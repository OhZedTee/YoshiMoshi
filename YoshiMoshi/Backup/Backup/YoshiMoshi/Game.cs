  Program Description: This XNA program is a tile based platformer similar to that
                       of Mario, with some tweaks. Its a fun, interactive game
                       to pass by time. It contains 4 levels, a high score system,
                       leaderboards, a hunger system, and much much more. This
                       specific file contains all the game changers, and basically
                       runs the game.
